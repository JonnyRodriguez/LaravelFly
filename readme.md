LaravelFly runs Laravel much faster, and make Tinker to be used online(use tinker while Laravel is responding requests from browsers).

Thanks to [Laravel](http://laravel.com/), [Swoole](https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src) and [PsySh](https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh)

## Quick Start

1.`pecl install swoole`   
Make sure `extension=swoole.so` in config file for php cli.   
Suggest: `pecl install inotify`   

2.`composer require "scil/laravel-fly":"dev-master"`

3.`php vendor/scil/laravel-fly/bin/fly start`   
If you enable `eval(tinker())` and see an error about mkdir, please start LaravelFly using sudo.

Now, your project is flying and listening to port 9501. Enjoy yourself.

## Speed Test

### A simple ab test 

 `ab -k -n 1000 -c 10 http://zc.test/green `

.   | fpm |  Fly Mode Simple | Fly Mode Map
------------ | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
Requests per second   | 3 |  5  | 34
Time taken â‰ˆ | 325 | 195  | 30
  50%  | 2538|   167  | 126
  80%  |   3213|  383   | 187
  99%   | 38584| 33720  | 3903

<details>
<summary>Test Env</summary>
<div>


* A visit to http://zc.test/green relates to 5 Models and 5 db query.
* env:   
ubuntu 16.04 on virtualbox ( 2 CPU: i5-2450M 2.50GHz ; Memory: 1G  )  
php7.1 + opcache + 5 workers for both fpm and laravelfly ( phpfpm : pm=static  pm.max_children=5)
* Test date : 2018/02

## Tinker online: use tinker when laravel is working

### used in router

```php
Route::get('hi', function () {
    $friends = 'Tinker';

    if (starts_with(Request::ip(), ['192.168', '127'])) {
        eval(tinker());
    }

    return view('fly', compact('friends'));
});
```

### used in view file

```blade.php
@php(eval(tinker()))

@foreach($friends as $one)

    <p>Hello, {!! $one !!}!</p>

@endforeach
```

<details>
<summary>The response can be changed to anything by you.</summary>
<div>

```
Hello, Tinker!

Hello, PsySh!

Hello, World!
```


</div>
</details>



### tinker abilities

visit private members, read/write vars, use laravel services and so on.

<details>
<summary>tinker use examples.</summary>
<div>


```php
// visit private members
sudo app()->booted
sudo $view= app()::$corDict[1]['instances']['view']

// use Model or Controller without writing namespace, thanks to ClassAliasAutoloader
// and the instance is printed beautifully, thanks to casters provided by laravel
$user = User::first()

// like dir() in Python
ls -la $user

// read doc
doc $user->save

// check code
show $user->query

// use xdebug
xdebug_debug_zval('user')
xdebug_debug_zval('url->routes')
xdebug_call_class()

// magic var
$__file

// check server pid and pidfile
LaravelFly::getServer()

// which class aliases are defined in tinker
sudo app('tinker')->loader->classes

// run shell commands
`pwd && ls `

```

</div>

### tinker demo

### Tinker Tips

`eval(tinker())` is a `eval(\Psy\sh())` with extra support for Laravel. It can be used independently without LaravelFly server, but LaravelFly applies the opportunity to use shell online.

There may be a problem with tabcompletion. see [tabcompletion only works "the second time](https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh/issues/435)

If you see an error about permission, please `sudo chmod -R 0777 ~/.config/psysh`

## LaravelFly Usability 

It can be installed on your existing projects without affecting nginx/apache server, that's to say, you can run LaravelFly server and nginx/apache server simultaneously to run the same laravel project.

The nginx conf [swoole_fallback_to_phpfpm.conf](config/swoole_fallback_to_phpfpm.conf) allow you use LaravelFlyServer as the primary server, and the phpfpm as a backup server which will be passed requests when the LaravelFlyServer is unavailable. .

Another nginx conf [use_swoole_or_fpm_depending_on_clients](config/use_swoole_or_fpm_depending_on_clients.conf) allows us use query string `?useserver=<swoole|fpm|...` to select the server between swoole or fpm. That's wonderful for test, such as to use eval(tinker()) as a online debugger for your fpm-supported projects.

## Tips for use

### global vars are not global any more

Global vars are only global in single swoole worker.

Swoole workers run in different process, vars are not shared by different workers. 

Methods to share vars between workers:
* Swoole tools like Table, Channel, ...
* Yac, Redis, Memcached, ...

### php functions not fit LaravelFly

name | replacement
------------ | ------------ 
header | Laravel Api: $response->header
setcookie | Laravel Api: $response->cookie

### Mode Map

Mode Map uses coroutine, so different requests can be handled by server concurrently. Suppose the server is handling a request, meet `co::sleep(3)` , then it goes to handle another request, later go back to the first request.

The basic services have been converted to be Coroutine Friendly and some tests have added to make sure the converted files can follow Laravel's new releases.  

There are some tips:
* Do not use super global vars like $_GET, $_POST, they are different among requests.
* If you use [Laravel Macros](https://tighten.co/blog/the-magic-of-laravel-macros), make sure they are always same in all of the requests. I've not made it Coroutine Friendly because I think in most situations they are always same.

## Todo

- [x] add events
- [x] aliases cache in ResolveSomeFacadeAliases
- [x] watch code changes and hot reload
- [x] watch maintenance mode using swoole_event_add
- [x] mysql coroutine
- [ ] mysql connection pool
- [ ] handle php config and laravel config like Zend in Mode Simple?
- [ ] handle php config and laravel config in Mode Map?
- [ ] websocket
- [ ] add tests about auth SessionGuard: Illuminate/Auth/SessionGuard.php with uses Request::createFromGlobals
- [ ] add tests about uploaded file, related symfony/http-foundation files: File/UploadedFile.php  and FileBag.php(fixPhpFilesArray)
- [ ] send file
- [ ] travis, static analyze like phan, phpstan or https://github.com/exakat/php-static-analysis-tools
- [ ] decrease worker ready time
- [ ] log fly: improve log on swoole
- [ ] cache fly

## Similar projects that mix swoole and laravel

* [laravoole](https://github.com/garveen/laravoole) : wonderful with many merits which LaravelFly will study. Caution: laravoole loads the app before any request ([onWorkerStart->parent::prepareKernel](https://github.com/garveen/laravoole/blob/master/src/Wrapper/Swoole.php)),  but it ignores data pollution, so please do not use any service which may change during a request, do not write any code that may change Laravel app or app('event') during a request, such as registering event .
