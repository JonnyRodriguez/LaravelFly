LaravelFly runs Laravel much faster, and make Tinker to be used online(use tinker while Laravel is responding requests from browsers).

Thanks to [Laravel](http://laravel.com/), [Swoole](https://github.com/swoole/swoole-src) and [PsySh](https://github.com/bobthecow/psysh)

## Quick Start

1.`pecl install swoole`   
Make sure `extension=swoole.so` in config file for php cli.   
LaravelFly Mode Map requires swoole 4.0.  
Suggest: `pecl install inotify`   

2.`composer require "scil/laravel-fly":"dev-master"`

3.`php artisan vendor:publish --tag=fly-app`   
This is publishing an app config file 

4.`php vendor/scil/laravel-fly/bin/fly start`   
If you enable `eval(tinker())` and see an error about mkdir, please start LaravelFly using sudo.

Now, your project is flying and listening to port 9501. Enjoy yourself.

By default, every time LaravelFly starts, it makes a config cache file laravelfly_ps_map.php or laravelfly_ps_simple.php located bootstrap/cache, so if config file `config/laravelfly.php` changes you can change config 'laravelfly.config_cache_always' to false in dev env , or run `php artisan config:clear` before starting LaravelFly in production env:
```
alias ff='php artisan config:clear && php vendor/scil/laravel-fly/bin/fly start'

ff
```

## Speed Test

### A simple ab test 

 `ab -k -n 1000 -c 10 http://zc.test/green `

.   | fpm |  Fly Mode Simple | Fly Mode Map
------------ | ------------ | ------------- | ------------- 
Requests per second   | 3 |  5  | 34

* A visit to http://zc.test/green relates to 5 Models and 5 db query.

ubuntu 16.04 on virtualbox ( 2 CPU: i5-2450M 2.50GHz ; Memory: 1G  )  
php7.1 + opcache + 5 workers for both fpm and laravelfly ( phpfpm : pm=static  pm.max_children=5)

## LaravelFly Usability 

It can be installed on your existing projects without affecting nginx/apache server, that's to say, you can run LaravelFly server and nginx/apache server simultaneously to run the same laravel project.

The nginx conf [swoole_fallback_to_phpfpm.conf](config/swoole_fallback_to_phpfpm.conf) allow you use LaravelFlyServer as the primary server, and the phpfpm as a backup server which will be passed requests when the LaravelFlyServer is unavailable. .

Another nginx conf [use_swoole_or_fpm_depending_on_clients](config/use_swoole_or_fpm_depending_on_clients.conf) allows us use query string `?useserver=<swoole|fpm|...` to select the server between swoole or fpm. That's wonderful for test, such as to use eval(tinker()) as a online debugger for your fpm-supported projects.

## Similar projects that mix swoole and laravel

* [laravel-swoole](https://github.com/swooletw/laravel-swoole): It is alse a safe sollution. The main difference is that it uses clone almost everything to achiev safety, however LaravelFly uses only twice in Mode Map. Why? Because clone create new objects. Give an object X1, and another object Y holding a ref to X1, in a new request X1 is cloned to produce a new object X2, but object Y is still holding X1, not X2.

* [laravoole](https://github.com/garveen/laravoole) : wonderful with many merits which LaravelFly will study. Caution: laravoole loads the app before any request ([onWorkerStart->parent::prepareKernel](https://github.com/garveen/laravoole/blob/master/src/Wrapper/Swoole.php)),  but it ignores data pollution, so please do not use any service which may change during a request, do not write any code that may change Laravel app or app('event') during a request, such as registering event .

PHP Config | √ó  | | NA |  | 

üîß: configurable

Php Config not planed to support:    
1. It's useless 
2. It's hard to achive as it's related with php internal function ini_set.  

## Todo Abut Safe: Mode Map

Base Services: url(UrlGenerator) | üñè  |  cloneü§ù ,its routes and request would update auto (registerUrlGenerator) and also routeGenerator when setRequest. But four props 'sessionResolver','keyResolver', 'formatHostUsing','formatPathUsing' are not cloned, as closure | ‚àö | |

üñè: works well in most cases, except basic config different in different requests. for example, UrlGenerator::$formatHostUsing is a callback/closure and keep same in most projects.But if your project has different formatHostUsing, plus hack work is needed.
üîßüñè: configurable, and works well in most cases after configration.



## None-Base Services
Then can be booted on worker or not.If you boot some of them before any requests, this table is useful.

- [ ] AuthServiceProvider 


support no planned
- [ ] .No plan to make its members 
- [ ] Laravel Macros. In Mode Map, macros are not supported to avoid data pollution, because in most situations macros are always same.
- [ ] Php Config. It's not supported in the near future. 


## Todo About Improvement

- [x] Config cache. laravelfly_ps_map.php or laravelfly_ps_simple.php located bootstrap/cache
- [x] Log cache. Server config 'log_cache'.
- [x] Cache for view compiled path. LARAVELFLY_SERVICES['view.finder'] or  App config 'view_compile_1'

## Other Todo

- [x] add events
